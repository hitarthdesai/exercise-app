Built this workout tracking app while trying to learn iOS developement.

Beyond some basic functionality like user authentication, and a couple forms for tracking workouts, sets and reps, there isn't much that I added to the app since I was still figuring out how swift and swift ui work.

I no longer intend to maintain this project, unless of course I decide to come back to iOS development.
